        <h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
<p>(3 credit hours) Fundamental theorems on continuous functions; convergence theory of sequences, series and integrals; the Riemann integral. Credit for both MA 425 and MA 511 is not allowed.</p>
<p>Prerequisite. MA 341. MA 225 is desirable but not required.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>MA 511 is an introduction to mathematical analysis. Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Explain the foundational concepts of real analysis, including set theory basics, limits, completeness, continuity, differentiability, integrability, and convergence of functions and sequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construct clear and rigorous mathematical proofs, using common methods such as direct proof, contradiction, contrapositive, and induction, with attention to logical structure and written clarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply theorems precisely and appropriately to analyze and compare the behavior of sets, sequences, functions, and series in one-variable calculus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interpret and connect definitions and major results in analysis to support problem-solving and deeper conceptual understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate mathematical arguments effectively, demonstrating fluency with the language, notation, and conventions of analysis.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We will focus some attention on learning to write mathematical proofs. Proofs will be graded not only for content but also for writing and style. (A mathematically correct proof which is poorly written may receive a low grade.)</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h3>
<p>In general this course will consist of three interactive video lectures per week with a weekly quiz, written homework assignments (approximately every two weeks), and three tests.</p>
<h4 id="lecture-materials">Lecture Materials</h4>
<p>Our lectures are contained in H5P modules on Moodle. During each lecture activity, you will be asked the equivalent of “in-class quiz questions.” These questions do not count towards your course grade, but give you a way to assess how well you are following the lecture. My hope is that you will find that the questions highlight major concepts and improve your understanding–they were written to guide you, not to test you. Some of these questions pop-up automatically, while others must be clicked on (typically look for a purple indicator or open circle both on the slides and along the progress bar).</p>
<ul>
<li>During “Interactive Video” lectures, you only get one attempt on these lecture questions–please read each one carefully. You cannot retry the lecture quiz questions. Remember that the questions are not graded (and I do not look at your scores). Just do your best!</li>
<li>During “Interactive Slides” lectures, you may reattempt some questions, however you cannot reattempt summary questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend you only begin a lecture if you can fully commit your attention to it. Note that you can pause and return at a later time. You can also speed up the pace of the lecture (up to 2x speed).</p>
<p>You must complete the lecture summary questions to see the Moodle quiz covering lecture material. Thus I recommend that you try to complete all lectures by each Friday at the latest.</p>
<p>Each lecture has slides and bookmarks to allow you to quickly reach content you wish to review.</p>
<p><em>You may watch the videos directly in YouTube if you prefer. However, you must answer the pop-up questions in Moodle to get points to unlock the weekly quizzes. Thus you should not exclusively watch the course content in YouTube.</em></p>
<h4 id="student-choice-lecture">Student Choice Lecture</h4>
<p>The required lectures cover the fundamental ideas of real analysis on ℝ.</p>
<p>Since many students who take MA 511 are graduate students in other disciplines, you may be interested in applying real analysis in various situations. Thus I have prepared eight additional topics from the textbook.</p>
<p>Throughout the semester, you must choose one of these “Student Choice” lectures. You will watch the lecture and complete the required assignment–there will be no examination questions on these topics. These lectures have been interspersed throughout the weeks based on when they are most relevant to the required material; however, the activity is not due until the end of the last week of class. Here is a list of these topics, together with my recommendations:</p>
<p>Choose one of the lectures below and complete its assignment by the end of the semester. The "Recommended for" column notes typical audiences and any prerequisites.</p>

<p>If you see a section or topic in a Real Analysis I/Advanced Calculus I book which has not been mentioned but which piques your interest, you may request a different topic before the last month of class. I will see if the topic is suitable and prepare an activity for you (or you can suggest good problems!).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="communication-and-getting-help">Communication and Getting Help</h3>
<h4 id="forum">Forum</h4>
<p>We will use <strong>Piazza</strong> for class discussion and homework questions. You are encouraged to use Piazza to discuss concepts and homework with discretion-hints and suggestions are okay, but full solutions will be deleted. You can post under your name or you may be anonymous to your classmates; however, the instructor will be able to see who you are. Please be respectful of your fellow classmates' ideas and attempts. If you have a math question you are not sure should be a public post, it is better to send me a direct message as a private post on Piazza.</p>
<p>Enroll in this class Piazza through the Piazza link near the top of Moodle.</p>
<p>Request: when asking a question about a specific item (like an item in Moodle), please include a direct link to that item (e.g. the Moodle url). It helps everyone answer your question a lot faster.</p>
<h4 id="email">Email</h4>
<p>Email may be used for confidential and private discussions about grades, scheduling office hours, etc. In general, I may not respond to email outside of business hours (M-F, 9am-5pm). It may take 24-72 hours for me to respond to an email. Please include MA 511 in the subject of the email. Math questions are best asked in office hours or on our on forum, not by email.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<p>There are two types of homework in this class: Moodle quizzes (completed entirely in Moodle) and written homework (submitted to the grading platform Gradescope through Moodle). You are responsible for tracking quiz and homework due dates.</p>
<h4 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h4>
<p>There are weekly ∼45-minute quizzes on Moodle which become available following completion of the lectures. Quizzes will require you to demonstrate knowledge of definitions and theorems. You may be asked to provide specific statements and will be evaluated based on correct and precise wording; using a computer is likely more convenient than using a phone for the quizzes. Although the quizzes are open notes/open book, your success in the course is closely linked to your familiarity with the terminology–heavy dependence during the quizzes on notes/books is discouraged.</p>
<p>On most quizzes you have two attempts per problemand one overall submission (so do not submit the entire quiz until you are done with each question). If your first attempt on a question is not correct, you can click on your answer and reattempt the question.</p>
<p>You can start a quiz, answer a few questions, close your browser, and resume later on a different device. You do not need to complete the quiz in one sitting. You also do not need to formally “submit” the quiz–Moodle will submit it on your behalf at the deadline.</p>
<h4 id="written-homework">Written Homework</h4>
<p>Homework assignments in real analysis are often challenging and lengthy. You should begin working on them as soon as possible. All homework assignments are posted on Moodle and are due by 11pm (Eastern) on the listed day. Homework will be submitted through Gradescope.</p>
<p>On each homework assignment, you may work in a group (up to 4... 2-3 is ideal). Let me know if you would like to be introduced to other classmates looking for a group, or you can reach out to everyone on Piazza. If you work in a group, be sure to declare all members with the submission by clicking this button: (and only one person should submit).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="test-information">Test Information</h3>
<p>There will be three “midterm” examinations–the final exam is Midterm 3. The exams each test about one third of the course. While they are not written to test earlier material deliberately, as the course progresses some questions will naturally rely on your mastery of earlier topics.</p>
<h4 id="test-dates">Test Dates</h4>
<ul>
<li>Test 1: TBD</li>
<li>Test 2: TBD</li>
<li>Test 3: TBD</li>
<li>Final Exam: TBD</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="calculators">Calculators</h4>
<p>You may use scientific calculators on exams. These calculators must not have calculus capabilities (differentiation, integration), CAS (computer algebra system) capabilities, or access to the internet.</p>
<p>See the Moodle guide Calculator Guidelines for a list of appropriate calculators. If you are on-campus, you may rent a suitable calculator from the NC State Libraries: <a href="https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/devices/calculators">Calculator rentals at NC State Libraries</a>.</p>

<h4 id="requirements-for-credit-only-su-grading">Requirements for Credit-Only (S/U) Grading</h4>
<p>In order to receive a grade of S, students are required to take all exams, complete all assignments, and earn a grade of C- or better. Conversion from letter grading to credit only (S/U) grading is subject to university deadlines. Refer to the Registration and Records calendar for deadlines related to grading. For more details refer to <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-15">REG 02.20.15 - Credit-Only Courses.</a></p>
<p>It is the student's responsibility to check if an S grade gives progress towards their degree(s).</p>
<h4 id="requirements-for-auditors-au">Requirements for Auditors (AU)</h4>
<p>Information about and requirements for auditing a course can be found at <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-04">REG 02.20.04 - Audits.</a></p>
<h4 id="policies-on-incomplete-grades">Policies on Incomplete Grades</h4>
<h5 id="nc-state-policy">NC State Policy</h5>
<p>At the discretion of the instructor, students may be given an IN grade for work not completed because of a serious interruption in their work not caused by their own negligence. An IN must not be used, however, as a substitute for an F when the student's performance in the course is deserving of failing. An IN is only appropriate when the student's record in the course is such that the successful completion of particular assignments, projects, or tests missed as a result of a documented serious event would enable that student to pass the course.</p>
<p>If an extended deadline is not authorized by the instructor or department, an unfinished incomplete grade will automatically change to an F after either (a) the end of the next regular semester in which the student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) the end of 12 months if the student is not enrolled, whichever is shorter. Incompletes that change to F will count as an attempted course on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade is the responsibility of the student. See the university policy on incomplete grades: <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03">REG 02.50.03 - Grades and Grade Point Average.</a></p>

<h3 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h3>
<h4 id="student-expenses">Student Expenses</h4>
<p>There are no expected expenses for this course.</p>
<h4 id="late-assignments">Late Assignments</h4>
<p>Generally no late assignments are accepted in this course. Please plan your work carefully and submit assignments by their stated deadlines. Extensions may be occasionally granted by the instructor for extenuating circumstances, which are best documented with <a href="https://osla.dasa.ncsu.edu/absence-verification-process/">NC State Absence Verification.</a></p>
<p>For longer-term, recurring, or more serious illness or other interruptions to your participation in this class, you should reach out to your instructor as soon as you can.</p>
<h4 id="late-examinations">Late Examinations</h4>
<p><em>Excused absense.</em> If an exam is missed with an excused absence (that is, for a university-approved reason with supporting documentation), then a make-up test will be scheduled individually. The make-up test may contain different questions and be assessed differently than the regular test. Documentation for an excused absence must be provided within 1 week of the missed class. All absences that require a make-up exam or other special accommodations must go through the NC State University absence verification process. Here is the link to that office: <a href="https://osla.dasa.ncsu.edu/absence-verification-process/">NC State Absence Verification.</a></p>
<p><em>Failure to schedule.</em> You must schedule exams in a timely fashion to guarantee that you will be able to take them. It is the instructor’s discretion whether a make-up exam will be allowed if you are not able to schedule an exam appointment within the selected time frame. If the instructor approves a make-up exam, there may be a 10% penalty on that exam. The make-up test may contain different questions and be assessed differently than the regular test.</p>
<p><em>Other absences.</em> If an exam is missed for an unexcused absence, that exam will be given a score of 0.</p>
<h4 id="attendance">Attendance</h4>
<p>Since this course is an asynchronous online course, there is no daily attendance. Instead, each student's participation in Moodle is tracked to check for regular activity. For complete attendance and excused absence policies, please see Attendance Regulations (<a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03">NCSU REG 02.20.03</a>).</p>

<p>NC State University provides equality of opportunity in education and employment for all students and employees. Accordingly, NC State affirms its commitment to maintain a work environment for all employees and an academic environment for all students that is free from all forms of discrimination. Discrimination based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation is a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State University policy and will not be tolerated. Harassment of any person (either in the form of quid pro quo or creation of a hostile environment) based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation also is a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State University policy and will not be tolerated. Retaliation against any person who complains about discrimination is also prohibited. NC State's policies and regulations covering discrimination, harassment, and retaliation may be accessed at</p>

<h4 id="course-evaluations">Course Evaluations</h4>
<p>ClassEval is the end-of-semester survey for students to evaluate instruction of all university classes. The current survey is administered online and includes 12 closed-ended questions and 3 open-ended questions. Deans, department heads, and instructors may add a limited number of their own questions to these 15 common-core questions.</p>
<p>Each semester students' responses are compiled into a ClassEval report for every instructor and class. Instructors use the evaluations to improve instruction and include them in their promotion and tenure dossiers, while department heads use them in annual reviews. The reports are included in instructors' personnel files and are considered confidential.</p>
<p>Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete during the last two weeks of the semester for full semester courses and the last week of shorter sessions. Students will receive an email directing them to a website to complete class evaluations. These become unavailable at 8am on the first day of finals.</p>
