        <h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
<p>(3 credit hours) Actuarial science is the discipline that applies mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in insurance, finance, and other industries and professions. To become an actuary, one must pass a series of specialized exams on actuarial mathematics. This course covers (some of) the material for SOA Exam MLC: Models for Life Contingencies and SOA Exam FM: Financial Mathematics. Specifically, the course covers survival models, life tables, selection, insurance benefits, annuities, premium calculation, and time permitting, multiple state models. We will also introduce and review key concepts from probability theory and interest theory, as needed.  The material for this class will cover chapters 1-6 and 8 of the textbook, with extra material from other texts as needed.</p>
<p>Prerequisite: MA 241 or MA 231 (Specifically, computing integrals and working with finite and infinite series).</p>
<p>Corequisite: One of MA 421, BUS[ST] 350, ST 301, ST 305, ST 311, ST 361, ST 370, ST 371, ST 380 (Specifically, material on random variables).</p>

<h3 id="communication-and-getting-help">Communication and Getting Help</h3>
<h4 id="forum">Forum</h4>
<p>The course will use a <strong>Moodle Discussion Forum</strong> for asking and answering questions regarding the homework, exam preparation, and logistics. If you have a question, then one of your classmates may have already asked it on the forum; if not, you can make a new post. Students can answer each other’s questions, and instructors will monitor the forum regularly.</p>
<h4 id="email">Email</h4>
<p>Email may be used for confidential and private discussions about grades, scheduling office hours, etc. In general, I may not respond to email outside of business hours (M-F, 9am-5pm). It may take 24-72 hours for me to respond to an email. Please include MA 412 in the subject of the email. Math questions are best asked in office hours or on our on forum, not by email.</p>
<h4 id="tutoring-centers">Tutoring Centers</h4>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<h4 id="moodle-online-homework">Moodle Online Homework</h4>
<p>Most weeks you will complete Moodle quizzes on the material, typically due Wednesdays at 11:59 PM. You should think of the Moodle quiz as another form of homework. The problems are multiple choice. There is no time limit so you can start and stop working on problems, discuss problems with other students, consult the book or lecture notes as you work, etc. Moodle quiz problems will tend to be numerical and somewhat shorter than the homework problems. There are two attempts per quiz.</p>
<h4 id="written-peer-graded-homework">Written Peer-Graded Homework</h4>
<p>Homework will be assigned on Moodle weekly and is typically due at 11:59 PM on Fridays (see the assignments in Moodle for specific dates). Homework will be submitted as a PDF through Gradescope. See <strong>Homework Preparation Guidelines</strong> on Moodle for information on how to prepare your homework.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="test-information">Test Information</h3>
<h4 id="proctors">Proctors</h4>
<p>All examinations will be proctored through DELTA. You will either take your exam with DELTA, or coordinate remote proctoring with DELTA, according to which situation best describes you:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you live less than 50 miles away from Raleigh, NC, then you will take your tests on our campus through the Distance Education Testing Centers. Students should be mindful of closing hours for both Testing Centers, and give themselves plenty of time to complete their exams. For information, please visit <a href="https://testing-services.delta.ncsu.edu/testing-services-on-campus/">DELTA on-campus testing services.</a></li>
<li>Those students who live more than 50 miles away from Raleigh, NC do not have to take their tests on NCSU campus. They may use a proctor in their town for testing. The proctor must be approved in advance through DELTA (not the instructor). It can take up to 1 week to verify a proctor and set up all needed contact info, so please do this early! Please visit the remote proctor website at <a href="https://testing-services.delta.ncsu.edu/testing-services-remote/">DELTA remote proctoring.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sign up your preferred time/date now! Time slots fill up fast!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the word <em>remote</em> in this context means that you are using a professional testing site (for example, a testing center, a local library, a college, etc.) other than DELTA. Remote testing does not mean testing at home.</p>
<h4 id="test-dates">Test Dates</h4>
<p>Here are the test dates for this course; as soon as possible, please sign up for a suitable time with your proctor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test 1: TBD</li>
<li>Test 2: TBD</li>
<li>Test 3: TBD</li>
<li>Final Exam: TBD</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="calculators">Calculators</h4>
<p>The Society of Actuaries permits the following Texas Instruments calculator models for exams. Use one of these models for lectures, homework, quizzes, and exams:</p>
<ul>
<li>BA-35  </li>
<li>BA II Plus  </li>
<li>BA II Plus Professional  </li>
<li>TI-30Xa  </li>
<li>TI-30X II (IIS — solar or IIB — battery)  </li>
<li>TI-30XS MultiView (or XB — battery)</li>
</ul>
<p>These calculators are inexpensive, have limited functionality (for example, no symbolic integration), and are well suited for course work and actuarial exams. If you are serious about becoming an actuary, purchase one now and use it consistently so you learn its functions and key‑press sequences.</p>
<p>If you are on campus, you may rent a suitable calculator from the NC State Libraries: <a href="https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/devices/calculators">NC State Libraries — calculator rentals</a>.</p>
<h4 id="test-format">Test Format</h4>
<p>Each exam will be taken as a Moodle quiz. If you select a remote proctor, your proctor must be able to administer this type of exam. You may not bring your own laptop to the testing center to take the exam.</p>

<h4 id="requirements-for-credit-only-su-grading">Requirements for Credit-Only (S/U) Grading</h4>
<p>In order to receive a grade of S, students are required to take all exams, complete all assignments, and earn a grade of C- or better. Conversion from letter grading to credit only (S/U) grading is subject to university deadlines. Refer to the Registration and Records calendar for deadlines related to grading. For more details refer to <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-15">REG 02.20.15 - Credit-Only Courses.</a></p>
<p>It is the student's responsibility to check if an S grade gives progress towards their degree(s).</p>
<h4 id="requirements-for-auditors-au">Requirements for Auditors (AU)</h4>
<p>Information about and requirements for auditing a course can be found at <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-04">REG 02.20.04 - Audits.</a></p>
<h4 id="policies-on-incomplete-grades">Policies on Incomplete Grades</h4>
<h5 id="nc-state-policy">NC State Policy</h5>
<p>At the discretion of the instructor, students may be given an IN grade for work not completed because of a serious interruption in their work not caused by their own negligence. An IN must not be used, however, as a substitute for an F when the student's performance in the course is deserving of failing. An IN is only appropriate when the student's record in the course is such that the successful completion of particular assignments, projects, or tests missed as a result of a documented serious event would enable that student to pass the course.</p>
<p>If an extended deadline is not authorized by the instructor or department, an unfinished incomplete grade will automatically change to an F after either (a) the end of the next regular semester in which the student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) the end of 12 months if the student is not enrolled, whichever is shorter. Incompletes that change to F will count as an attempted course on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade is the responsibility of the student. See the university policy on incomplete grades: <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03">REG 02.50.03 - Grades and Grade Point Average.</a></p>

<p>NC State University provides equality of opportunity in education and employment for all students and employees. Accordingly, NC State affirms its commitment to maintain a work environment for all employees and an academic environment for all students that is free from all forms of discrimination. Discrimination based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation is a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State University policy and will not be tolerated. Harassment of any person (either in the form of quid pro quo or creation of a hostile environment) based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation also is a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State University policy and will not be tolerated.

<h4 id="course-evaluations">Course Evaluations</h4>
<p>ClassEval is the end-of-semester survey for students to evaluate instruction of all university classes. The current survey is administered online and includes 12 closed-ended questions and 3 open-ended questions. Deans, department heads, and instructors may add a limited number of their own questions to these 15 common-core questions.</p>
<p>Each semester students' responses are compiled into a ClassEval report for every instructor and class. Instructors use the evaluations to improve instruction and include them in their promotion and tenure dossiers, while department heads use them in annual reviews. The reports are included in instructors' personnel files and are considered confidential.</p>
<p>Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete during the last two weeks of the semester for full semester courses and the last week of shorter sessions. Students will receive an email directing them to a website to complete class evaluations. These become unavailable at 8am on the first day of finals.</p>
