        <h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
<p>(3 credit hours) The course is an elementary introduction to matrix theory and linear algebra. Emphasis is given to topics that will be useful in other disciplines, including systems of equations, Euclidean vector spaces, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, linear transformations, similarity, and applications such as numerical solutions of equations and computer graphics. Compares with MA 405 Introductory Linear Algebra, more emphasis is placed on methods and calculations. Credit is not allowed for both MA 305 and MA 405.</p>
<p>Prerequisite: MA 241 or MA 231 with MA 132</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Determine the solvability of systems of linear equations, and solve such systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execute matrix operations, such as addition and multiplication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain the concept of subspaces, and find fundamental subspaces for matrices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe concepts of linear transformations, basis vectors, change of basis, and matrix representations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accurately interpret determinant and trace, as well as compute such quantities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain key ideas for diagonalizability, including eigenvectors, Jordan form. Describe and execute algorithms for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain key ideas related to orthogonality, such as inner-products, Gram-Schmidt, projections and the SVD, and compute related quantities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain some basic applications of linear algebra, such as least squares, calculus and geometry in multiple dimensions, and solutions of differential equations.</p>

<h4 id="lecture-materials">Lecture Materials</h4>
<p>Course lectures were prepared and recorded specifically for this section of MA 305 by Dr. Alina Duca. They are hosted on Panopto, and students should access them through the course Moodle page. Note that Safari sometimes does not allow this, whereas Chrome and Firefox are more user friendly.</p>
<p>In this online asynchronous course, the video content is designed to approximate the 150 minutes of weekly contact time typical of a regular semester course. However, please note that the duration of video content may vary from week to week. Some weeks may feature more than 150 minutes of videos, while others may have less.</p>
<p>You may shift your viewing schedule each week to accommodate your own schedule. However, please keep in mind that this online, distance-education course is fast-paced, and it may become difficult to catch up if you fall behind.</p>

<h4 id="proctors">Proctors</h4>
<p>All examinations will be proctored through DELTA. You will either take your exam with DELTA, or coordinate remote proctoring with DELTA, according to which situation best describes you:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you live less than 50 miles away from Raleigh, NC, then you will take your tests on our campus through the Distance Education Testing Centers. Students should be mindful of closing hours for both Testing Centers, and give themselves plenty of time to complete their exams. For information, please visit <a href="https://testing-services.delta.ncsu.edu/testing-services-on-campus/">DELTA on-campus testing services.</a></li>
<li>Those students who live more than 50 miles away from Raleigh, NC do not have to take their tests on NCSU campus. They may use a proctor in their town for testing. The proctor must be approved in advance through DELTA (not the instructor). It can take up to 1 week to verify a proctor and set up all needed contact info, so please do this early! Please visit the remote proctor website at <a href="https://testing-services.delta.ncsu.edu/testing-services-remote/">DELTA remote proctoring.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sign up your preferred time/date now! Time slots fill up fast!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the word <em>remote</em> in this context means that you are using a professional testing site (for example, a testing center, a local library, a college, etc.) other than DELTA. Remote testing does not mean testing at home.</p>
<h4 id="calculators">Calculators</h4>
<p>You may use scientific calculators on exams. These calculators must not have calculus capabilities (differentiation, integration), CAS (computer algebra system) capabilities, or access to the internet.</p>
<p>See the Moodle guide Calculator Guidelines for a list of appropriate calculators. If you are on-campus, you may rent a suitable calculator from the NC State Libraries: <a href="https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/devices/calculators">Calculator rentals at NC State Libraries</a>.</p>
<h4 id="test-format">Test Format</h4>
<p>Each exam will be a written, in-person exam administered at an approved testing location. You must bring appropriate photo identification and any permitted materials specified in this syllabus and in my course announcements.</p>
<p>If you take the written exam at DELTA, then you will complete it on an iPad with an Apple Pencil.</p>

<h4 id="requirements-for-credit-only-su-grading">Requirements for Credit-Only (S/U) Grading</h4>
<p>In order to receive a grade of S, students are required to take all exams, complete all assignments, and earn a grade of C- or better. Conversion from letter grading to credit only (S/U) grading is subject to university deadlines. Refer to the Registration and Records calendar for deadlines related to grading. For more details refer to <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-15">REG 02.20.15 - Credit-Only Courses.</a></p>

<h4 id="policies-on-incomplete-grades">Policies on Incomplete Grades</h4>
<h5 id="nc-state-policy">NC State Policy</h5>
<p>At the discretion of the instructor, students may be given an IN grade for work not completed because of a serious interruption in their work not caused by their own negligence. An IN must not be used, however, as a substitute for an F when the student's performance in the course is deserving of failing. An IN is only appropriate when the student's record in the course is such that the successful completion of particular assignments, projects, or tests missed as a result of a documented serious event would enable that student to pass the course.</p>
<p>If an extended deadline is not authorized by the instructor or department, an unfinished incomplete grade will automatically change to an F after either (a) the end of the next regular semester in which the student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) the end of 12 months if the student is not enrolled, whichever is shorter. Incompletes that change to F will count as an attempted course on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade is the responsibility of the student. See the university policy on incomplete grades: <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03">REG 02.50.03 - Grades and Grade Point Average.</a></p>

Accordingly, NC State affirms its commitment to maintain a work environment for all employees and an academic environment for all students that is free from all forms of discrimination. Discrimination based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation is a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State University policy and will not be tolerated. Harassment of any person (either in the form of quid pro quo or creation of a hostile environment) based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation also is a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State University policy and will not be tolerated.

<h4 id="course-evaluations">Course Evaluations</h4>
<p>ClassEval is the end-of-semester survey for students to evaluate instruction of all university classes. The current survey is administered online and includes 12 closed-ended questions and 3 open-ended questions. Deans, department heads, and instructors may add a limited number of their own questions to these 15 common-core questions.</p>
<p>Each semester students' responses are compiled into a ClassEval report for every instructor and class. Instructors use the evaluations to improve instruction and include them in their promotion and tenure dossiers, while department heads use them in annual reviews. The reports are included in instructors' personnel files and are considered confidential.</p>
<p>Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete during the last two weeks of the semester for full semester courses and the last week of shorter sessions. Students will receive an email directing them to a website to complete class evaluations. These become unavailable at 8am on the first day of finals.</p>
