<h3 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h3>
<h4 id="lecture-materials">Lecture Materials</h4>
<p>Linear algebra provides one of the cornerstones for much of modern mathematics and has important applications in physics, engineering, and economics. The main purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts from linear algebra, explain the underlying theory, the computational techniques, and study how these concepts and results can be productively used in other areas of mathematics and physical sciences, especially in applied mathematics where multivariable models are involved. Among the topics covered in this course will be: solving systems of linear equations using Gauss elimination, row echelon form, determinants, vector spaces, linear independence, bases, dimension, linear transformations, orthogonality, eigenvalues, and reduction of matrices to diagonal forms.</p>
<p>The subject involves a mixture of both the practical and the theoretical and will provide in particular a good introduction to mathematical proofs. For this reason, the course is considered to be a difficult one in undergraduate mathematics, and the student should be prepared to invest a considerable amount of time in understanding the class material and doing homework.</p>
<p>Course lectures were prepared and recorded specifically for this section of MA 405 by Dr. Alina Duca. They are hosted on Panopto, and students should access them through the course Moodle page. Note that Safari sometimes does not allow this, whereas Chrome and Firefox are more user friendly.</p>
<p>In this online asynchronous course, the video content is designed to approximate the 150 minutes of weekly contact time typical of a regular semester course. However, please note that the duration of video content may vary from week to week. Some weeks may feature more than 150 minutes of videos, while others may have less.</p>
<p>You may shift your viewing schedule each week to accommodate your own schedule. However, please keep in mind that this online, distance-education course is fast-paced, and it may become difficult to catch up if you fall behind.</p>
<h4 id="live-sessions">Live sessions</h4>
<p>TBD.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="communication-and-getting-help">Communication and Getting Help</h3>
<h4 id="forum">Forum</h4>
<p>We will use the Yellowdig platform for our course community and discussions. Ideally, math questions should be asked in office hours or on Yellowdig. In general, I will not answer math questions sent by email-if you have a math question you would like to send to me, please post it on Yellowdig. I will monitor and respond to questions on Yellowdig.</p>
<p>As you create posts and make comments, and as other students react to or comment on your posts, you will automatically receive participation points. The points you earn in Yellowdig are passed to the Moodle gradebook for your discussion credit.</p>
<p>To get 100% for your recitation score, you will need to accumulate points each week over the course of the semester. Here is how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are "weekly periods" in the course. The forum will open on the first day of class, which will serve as the first "week". Holiday weeks (Fall Break, Thanksgiving Break) are merged with neighboring weeks, and the week of final exams is merged with the last week of class.</li>
<li>To stay on pace, you should aim to earn 1000 points for each weekly period. However, you can actually earn up to 1350 points per week. Therefore, you can create a buffer in case you fall short in any week.</li>
<li>At 11:59 pm at the end of each weekly period, the weekly points will reset. You will have a new period in which to earn up to 1350/1000. You can keep posting even after you have reached the weekly maximum; you just will stop earning additional credit toward your grade until the next reset.</li>
<li>You may exceed the maximum semester point total in Yellowdig, but the maximum score in Moodle is 100%.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start, please use the "Introductions/Community" Topic and share a bit about who you are and what you are hoping to get out of taking this class. Please feel welcome to share pictures, videos, or interesting links about you and your accomplishments!</p>
<h4 id="email">Email</h4>
<p>Email may be used for confidential and private discussions about grades, scheduling office hours, etc. In general, I may not respond to email outside of business hours (M-F, 9am-5pm). It may take 24-72 hours for me to respond to an email. Please include MA 405 in the subject of the email. Math questions are best asked in office hours or on our on forum, not by email.</p>
<h4 id="tutoring-centers">Tutoring Centers</h4>
<p>During the regular school year, there is free help available on campus for MA 405. See the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu/undergraduate/courses-faq/math-multimedia-center/">Math Tutoring Center (MTC)</a> in SAS 2105. This room has many computers available so that you can work on your assignments. The room is a low-stress environment: you may work quietly in the room without engaging a tutor, or you may ask questions of the graduate tutors when they are available.</li>
<li><a href="https://asc.dasa.ncsu.edu/tutoring-and-mentoring/drop-in-tutoring/">Academic Success Center (ASC)</a> in D.H. Hill Library has a few options:<ul>
<li><a href="https://asc.dasa.ncsu.edu/tutoring-and-mentoring/drop-in-tutoring/">ASC Drop-In Tutoring</a></li>

<h4 id="proctors">Proctors</h4>
<p>All examinations will be proctored through DELTA. You will either take your exam with DELTA, or coordinate remote proctoring with DELTA, according to which situation best describes you:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you live less than 50 miles away from Raleigh, NC, then you will take your tests on our campus through the Distance Education Testing Centers. Students should be mindful of closing hours for both Testing Centers, and give themselves plenty of time to complete their exams. For information, please visit <a href="https://testing-services.delta.ncsu.edu/testing-services-on-campus/">DELTA on-campus testing services.</a></li>
<li>Those students who live more than 50 miles away from Raleigh, NC do not have to take their tests on NCSU campus. They may use a proctor in their town for testing. The proctor must be approved in advance through DELTA (not the instructor). It can take up to 1 week to verify a proctor and set up all needed contact info, so please do this early! Please visit the remote proctor website at <a href="https://testing-services.delta.ncsu.edu/testing-services-remote/">DELTA remote proctoring.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sign up your preferred time/date now! Time slots fill up fast!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the word <em>remote</em> in this context means that you are using a professional testing site (for example, a testing center, a local library, a college, etc.) other than DELTA. Remote testing does not mean testing at home.</p>
<h4 id="calculators">Calculators</h4>
<p>You may use scientific calculators on exams. These calculators must not have calculus capabilities (differentiation, integration), CAS (computer algebra system) capabilities, or access to the internet.</p>
<p>See the Moodle guide Calculator Guidelines for a list of appropriate calculators. If you are on-campus, you may rent a suitable calculator from the NC State Libraries: <a href="https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/devices/calculators">Calculator rentals at NC State Libraries</a>.</p>
<h4 id="test-format">Test Format</h4>
<p>Each exam will be a written, in-person exam administered at an approved testing location. You must bring appropriate photo identification and any permitted materials specified in this syllabus and in my course announcements.</p>
<p>If you take the written exam at DELTA, then you will complete it on an iPad with an Apple Pencil.</p>

<p>In order to receive a grade of S, students are required to take all exams, complete all assignments, and earn a grade of C- or better. Conversion from letter grading to credit only (S/U) grading is subject to university deadlines. Refer to the Registration and Records calendar for deadlines related to grading. For more details refer to <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-15">REG 02.20.15 - Credit-Only Courses.</a></p>

<h4 id="policies-on-incomplete-grades">Policies on Incomplete Grades</h4>
<h5 id="nc-state-policy">NC State Policy</h5>
<p>At the discretion of the instructor, students may be given an IN grade for work not completed because of a serious interruption in their work not caused by their own negligence. An IN must not be used, however, as a substitute for an F when the student's performance in the course is deserving of failing. An IN is only appropriate when the student's record in the course is such that the successful completion of particular assignments, projects, or tests missed as a result of a documented serious event would enable that student to pass the course.</p>
<p>If an extended deadline is not authorized by the instructor or department, an unfinished incomplete grade will automatically change to an F after either (a) the end of the next regular semester in which the student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) the end of 12 months if the student is not enrolled, whichever is shorter. Incompletes that change to F will count as an attempted course on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade is the responsibility of the student. See the university policy on incomplete grades: <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03">REG 02.50.03 - Grades and Grade Point Average.</a></p>

<h3 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h3>
<h4 id="student-expenses">Student Expenses</h4>
<p>There are no expected expenses for this course.</p>
<h4 id="late-assignments">Late Assignments</h4>
<p>Generally no late assignments are accepted in this course. Please plan your work carefully and submit assignments by their stated deadlines. Extensions may be occasionally granted by the instructor for extenuating circumstances, which are best documented with <a href="https://osla.dasa.ncsu.edu/absence-verification-process/">NC State Absence Verification.</a></p>
<p>For longer-term, recurring, or more serious illness or other interruptions to your participation in this class, you should reach out to your instructor as soon as you can.</p>
<h4 id="late-examinations">Late Examinations</h4>
<p><em>Excused absense.</em> If an exam is missed with an excused absence (that is, for a university-approved reason with supporting documentation), then a make-up test will be scheduled individually. The make-up test may contain different questions and be assessed differently than the regular test. Documentation for an excused absence must be provided within 1 week of the missed class. All absences that require a make-up exam or other special accommodations must go through the NC State University absence verification process. Here is the link to that office: <a href="https://osla.dasa.ncsu.edu/absence-verification-process/">NC State Absence Verification.</a></p>
<p><em>Failure to schedule.</em> You must schedule exams in a timely fashion to guarantee that you will be able to take them. It is the instructor’s discretion whether a make-up exam will be allowed if you are not able to schedule an exam appointment within the selected time frame. If the instructor approves a make-up exam, there may be a 10% penalty on that exam. The make-up test may contain different questions and be assessed differently than the regular test.</p>
<p><em>Other absences.</em> If an exam is missed for an unexcused absence, that exam will be given a score of 0.</p>
<h4 id="attendance">Attendance</h4>
<p>Since this course is an asynchronous online course, there is no daily attendance. Instead, each student's participation in Moodle is tracked to check for regular activity. For complete attendance and excused absence policies, please see Attendance Regulations (<a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03">NCSU REG 02.20.03</a>).</p>

<h4 id="course-evaluations">Course Evaluations</h4>
<p>ClassEval is the end-of-semester survey for students to evaluate instruction of all university classes. The current survey is administered online and includes 12 closed-ended questions and 3 open-ended questions. Deans, department heads, and instructors may add a limited number of their own questions to these 15 common-core questions.</p>
<p>Each semester students' responses are compiled into a ClassEval report for every instructor and class. Instructors use the evaluations to improve instruction and include them in their promotion and tenure dossiers, while department heads use them in annual reviews. The reports are included in instructors' personnel files and are considered confidential.</p>
<p>Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete during the last two weeks of the semester for full semester courses and the last week of shorter sessions. Students will receive an email directing them to a website to complete class evaluations. These become unavailable at 8am on the first day of finals.</p>
