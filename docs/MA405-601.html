<h3 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h3>
<h4 id="lecture-materials">Lecture Materials</h4>
<p>Linear algebra provides one of the cornerstones for much of modern mathematics and has important applications in physics, engineering, and economics. The main purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts from linear algebra, explain the underlying theory, the computational techniques, and study how these concepts and results can be productively used in other areas of mathematics and physical sciences, especially in applied mathematics where multivariable models are involved. Among the topics covered in this course will be: solving systems of linear equations using Gauss elimination, row echelon form, determinants, vector spaces, linear independence, bases, dimension, linear transformations, orthogonality, eigenvalues, and reduction of matrices to diagonal forms.</p>
<p>The subject involves a mixture of both the practical and the theoretical and will provide in particular a good introduction to mathematical proofs. For this reason, the course is considered to be a difficult one in undergraduate mathematics, and the student should be prepared to invest a considerable amount of time in understanding the class material and doing homework.</p>
<p>Course lectures were prepared and recorded specifically for this section of MA 405 by Dr. Alina Duca. They are hosted on Panopto, and students should access them through the course Moodle page. Note that Safari sometimes does not allow this, whereas Chrome and Firefox are more user friendly.</p>
<p>In this online asynchronous course, the video content is designed to approximate the 150 minutes of weekly contact time typical of a regular semester course. However, please note that the duration of video content may vary from week to week. Some weeks may feature more than 150 minutes of videos, while others may have less.</p>
<p>You may shift your viewing schedule each week to accommodate your own schedule. However, please keep in mind that this online, distance-education course is fast-paced, and it may become difficult to catch up if you fall behind.</p>

<h3 id="communication-and-getting-help">Communication and Getting Help</h3>
<h4 id="forum">Forum</h4>
<p>We will use <strong>Piazza</strong> for class discussion and homework questions. You are encouraged to use Piazza to discuss concepts and homework with discretion-hints and suggestions are okay, but full solutions will be deleted. You can post under your name or you may be anonymous to your classmates; however, the instructor will be able to see who you are. Please be respectful of your fellow classmates' ideas and attempts. If you have a math question you are not sure should be a public post, it is better to send me a direct message as a private post on Piazza.</p>
<p>Enroll in this class Piazza through the Piazza link near the top of Moodle.</p>
<p>Request: when asking a question about a specific item (like an item in Moodle), please include a direct link to that item (e.g. the Moodle url). It helps everyone answer your question a lot faster.</p>
<h4 id="email">Email</h4>
<p>Contact me for confidential and private discussions about grades, scheduling office hours, etc. Please include MA 405 in the subject line. In general, I may not respond to messages outside of business hours (M-F, 9am-5pm), and it may take 24-72 hours for me to respond to an message. Math questions are generally best asked in office hours or on our forum, not by email.</p>

<p>All examinations will be proctored through DELTA. You will either take your exam with DELTA, or coordinate remote proctoring with DELTA, according to which situation best describes you:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you live less than 50 miles away from Raleigh, NC, then you will take your tests on our campus through the Distance Education Testing Centers. Students should be mindful of closing hours for both Testing Centers, and give themselves plenty of time to complete their exams. For information, please visit <a href="https://testing-services.delta.ncsu.edu/testing-services-on-campus/">DELTA on-campus testing services.</a></li>
<li>Those students who live more than 50 miles away from Raleigh, NC do not have to take their tests on NCSU campus. They may use a proctor in their town for testing. The proctor must be approved in advance through DELTA (not the instructor). It can take up to 1 week to verify a proctor and set up all needed contact info, so please do this early! Please visit the remote proctor website at <a href="https://testing-services.delta.ncsu.edu/testing-services-remote/">DELTA remote proctoring.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sign up your preferred time/date now! Time slots fill up fast!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the word <em>remote</em> in this context means that you are using a professional testing site (for example, a testing center, a local library, a college, etc.) other than DELTA. Remote testing does not mean testing at home.</p>

Conversion from letter grading to credit only (S/U) grading is subject to university deadlines. Refer to the Registration and Records calendar for deadlines related to grading. For more details refer to <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-15">REG 02.20.15 - Credit-Only Courses.</a></p>
<p>It is the student's responsibility to check if an S grade gives progress towards their degree(s).</p>
<h4 id="requirements-for-auditors-au">Requirements for Auditors (AU)</h4>
<p>Information about and requirements for auditing a course can be found at <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-04">REG 02.20.04 - Audits.</a></p>
<h4 id="policies-on-incomplete-grades">Policies on Incomplete Grades</h4>
<h5 id="nc-state-policy">NC State Policy</h5>
<p>At the discretion of the instructor, students may be given an IN grade for work not completed because of a serious interruption in their work not caused by their own negligence. An IN must not be used, however, as a substitute for an F when the student's performance in the course is deserving of failing. An IN is only appropriate when the student's record in the course is such that the successful completion of particular assignments, projects, or tests missed as a result of a documented serious event would enable that student to pass the course.</p>
<p>If an extended deadline is not authorized by the instructor or department, an unfinished incomplete grade will automatically change to an F after either (a) the end of the next regular semester in which the student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) the end of 12 months if the student is not enrolled, whichever is shorter. Incompletes that change to F will count as an attempted course on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade is the responsibility of the student. See the university policy on incomplete grades: <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03">REG 02.50.03 - Grades and Grade Point Average.</a></p>

<hr />
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h3>
<h4 id="student-expenses">Student Expenses</h4>
<p>If you participate in the Course Ready program, then this covers the cost of WebAssign for you. Otherwise, the cost of WebAssign is approximately $118.00 for this class. To access WebAssign for the first time, please click on the first link in the WebAssign Homework Section. You will need to log into your Cengage account (or create an account). Do not create a new account if you already have a Cengage account.</p>
<h4 id="late-assignments">Late Assignments</h4>
<p>For WebAssign homework, you may take extensions on an assignment up to exactly 7 days after the assignment's original due date/time. You may take as many extensions as you wish during this 7 day extension period window.</p>
<p>Each extension lasts for 24 hours OR until the assignment is exactly 7 days past due, whichever comes first. To extend beyond 24 hours, you must wait for the original 24 hours to expire.</p>
<p>You will receive full credit for any answers you get correct before the original due date. Any work completed during the extension period will incur a penalty of -20%.</p>
<p>Note that these 7 days may include weekends, holidays, etc. The extension period is always for exactly one calendar week.</p>
<p>It may be possible in Cengage to extend due dates for the last few assignments beyond the time when I submit grades to MyPack. However, work completed after grades are submitted will not contribute to your semester grade. Please ensure that you have made up any extended work by your final exam.</p>
<p>For longer-term, recurring, or more serious illness or other interruptions to your participation in this class, you should reach out to your instructor as soon as you can.</p>
<h4 id="late-examinations">Late Examinations</h4>
<p><em>Excused absense.</em> If an exam is missed with an excused absence (that is, for a university-approved reason with supporting documentation), then a make-up test will be scheduled individually. The make-up test may contain different questions and be assessed differently than the regular test. Documentation for an excused absence must be provided within 1 week of the missed class. All absences that require a make-up exam or other special accommodations must go through the NC State University absence verification process. Here is the link to that office: <a href="https://osla.dasa.ncsu.edu/absence-verification-process/">NC State Absence Verification.</a></p>
<p><em>Failure to schedule.</em> You must schedule exams in a timely fashion to guarantee that you will be able to take them. It is the instructor’s discretion whether a make-up exam will be allowed if you are not able to schedule an exam appointment within the selected time frame. If the instructor approves a make-up exam, there may be a 10% penalty on that exam. The make-up test may contain different questions and be assessed differently than the regular test.</p>
<p><em>Other absences.</em> If an exam is missed for an unexcused absence, that exam will be given a score of 0.</p>
<h4 id="attendance">Attendance</h4>
<p>Since this course is an asynchronous online course, there is no daily attendance. Instead, each student's participation in Moodle is tracked to check for regular activity. For complete attendance and excused absence policies, please see Attendance Regulations (<a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03">NCSU REG 02.20.03</a>).</p>
<h4 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h4>
<p>Students are required to comply with the university policy on academic integrity found in the Code of Student Conduct (<a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01">NCSU POL11.35.01</a>). Your submission of any exam indicates "I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this test or assignment." Violations of academic integrity will be handled in accordance with the Student Discipline Procedures (<a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-11-35-02/">NCSU REG 11.35.02</a>).</p>
<p>Posting any course material to websites like Chegg, ChatGPT, and Course Hero is a violation of copyright law and course policy and is strictly prohibited. Violations of this policy will be reported to the <a href="https://studentconduct.dasa.ncsu.edu/">Office of Student Conduct</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tests: Proctored tests are closed book assessments. You may not consult any internet resources nor receive help from anyone else. Do not share information about the content on the exams with anyone else in the class. See the calculator policy in the Test Information section of this syllabus.</li>
<li>Homework: You may consult your notes, the textbook, each other, or online resources.</li>
<li>Forum discussion boards: You are encouraged to discuss mathematical concepts and problems with your classmates. However, you must arrive at your own solutions with your own work. Do not seek nor state final answers on the forum; focus on understanding the concepts.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="disability-resources">Disability Resources</h4>
<p>Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations, students must register with the Disability Resource Office at Holmes Hall, Suite 304, 2751 Cates Avenue, Campus Box 7509, 919-515-7653. For more information on NC State's policy on working with students with disabilities, please see the Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Regulation (<a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-01/">NCSU REG 02.20.01</a>).</p>
<p>Students who receive accommodations are responsible for filing those accommodations officially with DRO before the tests occur. It is not appropriate to tell the instructor that you should receive accommodations without going through the official channels. The instructor will only adjust test conditions after receiving the official Accommodation Letter Notification from DRO. Adjustments are never made retroactively to past examinations.</p>

<h4 id="course-evaluations">Course Evaluations</h4>
<p>ClassEval is the end-of-semester survey for students to evaluate instruction of all university classes. The current survey is administered online and includes 12 closed-ended questions and 3 open-ended questions. Deans, department heads, and instructors may add a limited number of their own questions to these 15 common-core questions.</p>
<p>Each semester students' responses are compiled into a ClassEval report for every instructor and class. Instructors use the evaluations to improve instruction and include them in their promotion and tenure dossiers, while department heads use them in annual reviews. The reports are included in instructors' personnel files and are considered confidential.</p>
<p>Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete during the last two weeks of the semester for full semester courses and the last week of shorter sessions. Students will receive an email directing them to a website to complete class evaluations. These become unavailable at 8am on the first day of finals.</p>
