<h3 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h3>
<h4 id="lecture-materials">Lecture Materials</h4>
<p>All course learning materials and resources are housed in our course Moodle. The video lectures were pre-recorded specifically for this course by Dr. Ilse Ipsen and are available on Moodle, where there are accompanying notes. The lectures should be viewed according to the schedule on Moodle. You may shift your viewing schedule each week to accommodate your own schedule; however, please keep in mind that this online, distance-education course is fast-paced, and it may become difficult to catch up if you fall behind.</p>
<p>Each module of the course will provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>video lectures</li>
<li>corresponding notes</li>
<li>homework assignments</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="communication-and-getting-help">Communication and Getting Help</h3>
<h4 id="forum">Forum</h4>
<p>The course will use a <strong>Moodle Discussion Forum</strong> for asking and answering questions regarding the homework, exam preparation, and logistics. If you have a question, then one of your classmates may have already asked it on the forum; if not, you can make a new post. Students can answer each other’s questions, and instructors will monitor the forum regularly.</p>
<h4 id="email">Email</h4>
<p>Email may be used for confidential and private discussions about grades, scheduling office hours, etc. In general, I may not respond to email outside of business hours (M-F, 9am-5pm). It may take 24-72 hours for me to respond to an email. Please include MA 523 in the subject of the email. Math questions are best asked in office hours or on our on forum, not by email.</p>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<p>There are three types of homework in this class: written assignments submitted via Gradescope, programming projects, and Moodle quizzes (with infinitely many attempts).</p>
<h4 id="moodle-quizzes">Moodle Quizzes</h4>
<p>You have infinitely many attempts on quiz questions. You can start a quiz, answer a few questions, close your browser, and resume later on a different device. You do not need to complete the quiz in one sitting. You also do not need to formally “submit” the quiz–Moodle will submit it on your behalf at the deadline. Thus I recommend trying to work through a few problems at a time, as soon as we have covered the relevant material.</p>
<h4 id="written-assignments">Written Assignments</h4>
<p>You will need to upload your written or typed work to Gradescope. I will grade each assignment holistically in Gradescope, and you will receive an automated email when the assessments are finished. The due dates for Gradescope assignments are listed on Gradescope and in Moodle.</p>
<h4 id="matlab-grader">MATLAB Grader</h4>
<p>Some homework sets are in MATLAB Grader, or have MATLAB Grader supplements. These MATLAB Grader questions are due by the day of the final exam. As with the Moodle quiz homework sets, you have infinitely many attempts on most of these questions, with instant feedback.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="test-information">Test Information</h3>
<p>There will be three “midterm” examinations–the final exam is Midterm 3. The exams each test about one third of the course. While they are not written to test earlier material deliberately, as the course progresses some questions will naturally rely on your mastery of earlier topics.</p>
<h4 id="test-dates">Test Dates</h4>
<ul>
<li>Test 1: TBD</li>
<li>Test 2: TBD</li>
<li>Final Exam: TBD</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="calculators">Calculators</h4>
<p>Calculators are not permitted on exams.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="classroom-expectations">Classroom Expectations</h3>

<h4 id="requirements-for-credit-only-su-grading">Requirements for Credit-Only (S/U) Grading</h4>
<p>In order to receive a grade of S, students are required to take all exams, complete all assignments, and earn a grade of C- or better. Conversion from letter grading to credit only (S/U) grading is subject to university deadlines. Refer to the Registration and Records calendar for deadlines related to grading. For more details refer to <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-15">REG 02.20.15 - Credit-Only Courses.</a></p>
<p>It is the student's responsibility to check if an S grade gives progress towards their degree(s).</p>
<h4 id="requirements-for-auditors-au">Requirements for Auditors (AU)</h4>
<p>Information about and requirements for auditing a course can be found at <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-04">REG 02.20.04 - Audits.</a></p>
<h4 id="policies-on-incomplete-grades">Policies on Incomplete Grades</h4>
<h5 id="nc-state-policy">NC State Policy</h5>
<p>At the discretion of the instructor, students may be given an IN grade for work not completed because of a serious interruption in their work not caused by their own negligence. An IN must not be used, however, as a substitute for an F when the student's performance in the course is deserving of failing. An IN is only appropriate when the student's record in the course is such that the successful completion of particular assignments, projects, or tests missed as a result of a documented serious event would enable that student to pass the course.</p>
<p>If an extended deadline is not authorized by the instructor or department, an unfinished incomplete grade will automatically change to an F after either (a) the end of the next regular semester in which the student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) the end of 12 months if the student is not enrolled, whichever is shorter. Incompletes that change to F will count as an attempted course on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade is the responsibility of the student. See the university policy on incomplete grades: <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03">REG 02.50.03 - Grades and Grade Point Average.</a></p>

<h3 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h3>
<h4 id="student-expenses">Student Expenses</h4>
<h4 id="late-assignments">Late Assignments</h4>
<p>Generally no late assignments are accepted in this course. Please plan your work carefully and submit assignments by their stated deadlines. Extensions may be occasionally granted by the instructor for extenuating circumstances, which are best documented with <a href="https://osla.dasa.ncsu.edu/absence-verification-process/">NC State Absence Verification.</a></p>
<p>For longer-term, recurring, or more serious illness or other interruptions to your participation in this class, you should reach out to your instructor as soon as you can.</p>
<h4 id="late-examinations">Late Examinations</h4>
<p><em>Excused absense.</em> If an exam is missed with an excused absence (that is, for a university-approved reason with supporting documentation), then a make-up test will be scheduled individually. The make-up test may contain different questions and be assessed differently than the regular test. Documentation for an excused absence must be provided within 1 week of the missed class. All absences that require a make-up exam or other special accommodations must go through the NC State University absence verification process. Here is the link to that office: <a href="https://osla.dasa.ncsu.edu/absence-verification-process/">NC State Absence Verification.</a></p>
<p><em>Failure to schedule.</em> You must schedule exams in a timely fashion to guarantee that you will be able to take them. It is the instructor’s discretion whether a make-up exam will be allowed if you are not able to schedule an exam appointment within the selected time frame. If the instructor approves a make-up exam, there may be a 10% penalty on that exam. The make-up test may contain different questions and be assessed differently than the regular test.</p>
<p><em>Other absences.</em> If an exam is missed for an unexcused absence, that exam will be given a score of 0.</p>
<h4 id="attendance">Attendance</h4>
<p>Since this course is an asynchronous online course, there is no daily attendance. Instead, each student's participation in Moodle is tracked to check for regular activity. For complete attendance and excused absence policies, please see Attendance Regulations (<a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03">NCSU REG 02.20.03</a>).</p>
<h4 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h4>
<p>Students are required to comply with the university policy on academic integrity found in the Code of Student Conduct (<a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01">NCSU POL11.35.01</a>). Your submission of any exam indicates "I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this test or assignment." Violations of academic integrity will be handled in accordance with the Student Discipline Procedures (<a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-11-35-02/">NCSU REG 11.35.02</a>).</p>
<p>Posting any course material to websites like Chegg, ChatGPT, and Course Hero is a violation of copyright law and course policy and is strictly prohibited. Violations of this policy will be reported to the <a href="https://studentconduct.dasa.ncsu.edu/">Office of Student Conduct</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tests: Proctored tests are closed book assessments. You may not consult any internet resources nor receive help from anyone else. Do not share information about the content on the exams with anyone else in the class. See the calculator policy in the Test Information section of this syllabus.</li>
<li>Homework: You may consult your notes, the textbook, each other, or online resources.</li>
<li>Forum discussion boards: You are encouraged to discuss mathematical concepts and problems with your classmates. However, you must arrive at your own solutions with your own work. Do not seek nor state final answers on the forum; focus on understanding the concepts.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="disability-resources">Disability Resources</h4>
<p>Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations, students must register with the Disability Resource Office at Holmes Hall, Suite 304, 2751 Cates Avenue, Campus Box 7509, 919-515-7653.

<h4 id="non-discrimination-policy">Non-Discrimination Policy</h4>
<p>NC State University provides equality of opportunity in education and employment for all students and employees. Accordingly, NC State affirms its commitment to maintain a work environment for all employees and an academic environment for all students that is free from all forms of discrimination. Discrimination based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation is a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State University policy and will not be tolerated. Harassment of any person (either in the form of quid pro quo or creation of a hostile environment) based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation also is a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State University policy and will not be tolerated. Retaliation against any person who complains about discrimination is also prohibited. NC State's policies and regulations covering discrimination, harassment, and retaliation may be accessed at</p>

<h4 id="course-evaluations">Course Evaluations</h4>
<p>ClassEval is the end-of-semester survey for students to evaluate instruction of all university classes. The current survey is administered online and includes 12 closed-ended questions and 3 open-ended questions. Deans, department heads, and instructors may add a limited number of their own questions to these 15 common-core questions.</p>
<p>Each semester students' responses are compiled into a ClassEval report for every instructor and class. Instructors use the evaluations to improve instruction and include them in their promotion and tenure dossiers, while department heads use them in annual reviews. The reports are included in instructors' personnel files and are considered confidential.</p>
<p>Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete during the last two weeks of the semester for full semester courses and the last week of shorter sessions. Students will receive an email directing them to a website to complete class evaluations. These become unavailable at 8am on the first day of finals.</p>
