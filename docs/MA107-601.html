<h3 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h3>
<h4 id="lecture-materials">Lecture Materials</h4>
<p>The material for this class is broken into 16 modules. Each week you will complete 1-2 modules. Each module consists of the following material: lecture videos, self-check quizzes, WebAssign assignments, a worksheet entitled “In Class Problems,” and occasionally self checks. Any references to "in-class exercises" do not mean that we meet in class (this course is asynchronous) but rather provide a way to map our online learning to the in-person sections of MA 111.</p>
<p>You may shift your viewing schedule each week to accommodate your own schedule. However, please keep in mind that this online, distance-education course is fast-paced, and it may become difficult to catch up if you fall behind.</p>
<h4 id="live-sessions">Live sessions</h4>
<p>TBD.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="communication-and-getting-help">Communication and Getting Help</h3>
<h4 id="forum">Forum</h4>
<p>We will use the Yellowdig platform for our course community and discussions. Ideally, math questions should be asked in office hours or on Yellowdig. In general, I will not answer math questions sent by email-if you have a math question you would like to send to me, please post it on Yellowdig. I will monitor and respond to questions on Yellowdig.</p>
<p>As you create posts and make comments, and as other students react to or comment on your posts, you will automatically receive participation points. The points you earn in Yellowdig are passed to the Moodle gradebook for your discussion credit.</p>
<p>To get 100% for your recitation score, you will need to accumulate points each week over the course of the semester. Here is how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are "weekly periods" in the course. The forum will open on the first day of class, which will serve as the first "week". Holiday weeks (Fall Break, Thanksgiving Break) are merged with neighboring weeks, and the week of final exams is merged with the last week of class.</li>
<li>To stay on pace, you should aim to earn 1000 points for each weekly period. However, you can actually earn up to 1350 points per week. Therefore, you can create a buffer in case you fall short in any week.</li>
<li>At 11:59 pm at the end of each weekly period, the weekly points will reset. You will have a new period in which to earn up to 1350/1000. You can keep posting even after you have reached the weekly maximum; you just will stop earning additional credit toward your grade until the next reset.</li>
<li>You may exceed the maximum semester point total in Yellowdig, but the maximum score in Moodle is 100%.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start, please use the "Introductions/Community" Topic and share a bit about who you are and what you are hoping to get out of taking this class. Please feel welcome to share pictures, videos, or interesting links about you and your accomplishments!</p>
<h4 id="email">Email</h4>
<p>Email may be used for confidential and private discussions about grades, scheduling office hours, etc. In general, I may not respond to email outside of business hours (M-F, 9am-5pm). It may take 24-72 hours for me to respond to an email. Please include MA 107 in the subject of the email. Math questions are best asked in office hours or on our on forum, not by email.</p>
<h4 id="tutoring-centers">Tutoring Centers</h4>
<p>During the regular school year, there is free help available on campus for MA 107. See the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu/undergraduate/courses-faq/math-multimedia-center/">Math Tutoring Center (MTC)</a> in SAS 2105. This room has many computers available so that you can work on your assignments. The room is a low-stress environment: you may work quietly in the room without engaging a tutor, or you may ask questions of the graduate tutors when they are available.</li>
<li><a href="https://asc.dasa.ncsu.edu/tutoring-and-mentoring/drop-in-tutoring/">Academic Success Center (ASC)</a> in D.H. Hill Library has a few options:<ul>
<li><a href="https://asc.dasa.ncsu.edu/tutoring-and-mentoring/drop-in-tutoring/">ASC Drop-In Tutoring</a></li>
<li><a href="https://asc.dasa.ncsu.edu/tutoring-and-mentoring/appointment-tutoring/">ASC Appointment Tutoring</a></li>
<li><a href="https://asc.dasa.ncsu.edu/tutoring-and-mentoring/weekly-group-tutoring/">ASC Weekly Group Tutoring</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For Drop-In Tutoring hours, notice the MTC is open during the day, and the ASC is open in the evening.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="textbook-and-webassign">Textbook and WebAssign</h3>
<p>We will use an Openstax Precalculus textbook, which is available for free here: <a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/precalculus">OpenStax Precalculus.</a></p>
<p>Please download the pdf so you can see the page numbers. The homework in WebAssign correlates to the exercises in this textbook.</p>
<p>Please see information about purchasing WebAssign under Student Expenses. Do not create a new account if you already have a Cengage account. If you have trouble accessing Cengage, please post on the class forum.</p>
<p>The WebAssign homework assignments are obtained, submitted, and graded online with grades appearing in the course Gradebook. Please find our assignments on Moodle.</p>
<h4 id="recommendations">Recommendations:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Work ahead of schedule. Due dates are chosen to ensure that you have ample time between the videos and the due dates, but you should work on the homework sets as you watch the videos.</li>
<li>Print each assignment and work it with pencil and paper before submitting. I recommend collection your final solutions in a binder, spiral notebook, or similar.</li>
<li>Number each homework set and your work for each problem so that you can study it later. Do not work problems out on unlabeled scratch paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your WebAssign average in the Moodle gradebook will be a weighted arithmetic mean based on each assignment's point total. For example, your score on an assignment worth 50 points counts more than your score on an assignment worth 10 points.</p>
<h4 id="webassign-due-dates">WebAssign Due Dates</h4>
<p>Due dates are listed with each assignment on WebAssign. I encourage you to work on each WebAssign as soon as possible—do not wait until the due date to begin. Please feel free to discuss WebAssign on Yellowdig (the course forum), including the specifics of problems and your attempts at solutions.</p>
<p>When you have finished an assignment, you can click Mark as done in Moodle to indicate for your records that the assignment is completed.</p>
<h4 id="extensions-and-dropped-grades">Extensions and Dropped Grades</h4>
<ul>
<li>Need extra time? WebAssign will also allow you to take a seven-day extension for 80% credit (a 20% penalty). You set this up yourself directly in WebAssign. How this works: if an assignment has 5 questions, each worth 10 points, and you need more time to finish #5, then your grade is a maximum 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 8 = 48. (The 80% does not affect the problems you did on time.)</li>
<li>Your three lowest scores, as determined by Moodle's computational algorithm, are automatically dropped in the Moodle gradebook.</li>
<li>A few sections may be marked as Extra Credit (up to instructor discretion). These are completely optional and the related material is not tested.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of these policies, extensions from the instructor are generally not given. You should try to complete every assignment as soon as you can and as best as you can so that you can self-extend assignments (and/or have them dropped) in case of emergencies. If you have extenuating circumstances that affect more than three assignments, please contact me to discuss your situation, but it needs to be first documented with Absence Verification.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="proctors">Proctors</h4>
<p>All examinations will be proctored through DELTA. You will either take your exam with DELTA, or coordinate remote proctoring with DELTA, according to which situation best describes you:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you live less than 50 miles away from Raleigh, NC, then you will take your tests on our campus through the Distance Education Testing Centers. Students should be mindful of closing hours for both Testing Centers, and give themselves plenty of time to complete their exams. For information, please visit <a href="https://testing-services.delta.ncsu.edu/testing-services-on-campus/">DELTA on-campus testing services.</a></li>
<li>Those students who live more than 50 miles away from Raleigh, NC do not have to take their tests on NCSU campus. They may use a proctor in their town for testing. The proctor must be approved in advance through DELTA (not the instructor). It can take up to 1 week to verify a proctor and set up all needed contact info, so please do this early! Please visit the remote proctor website at <a href="https://testing-services.delta.ncsu.edu/testing-services-remote/">DELTA remote proctoring.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the word <em>remote</em> in this context means that you are using a professional testing site (for example, a testing center, a local library, a college, etc.) other than DELTA. Remote testing does not mean testing at home.</p>
<h4 id="calculators">Calculators</h4>
<p>You may use basic (four-function) calculators on exams. These calculators must have no calculus or graphing capabilities. </p>
<p>If you are on-campus, you may rent a suitable calculator from the NC State Libraries: <a href="https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/devices/calculators">Calculator rentals at NC State Libraries</a>. See the Moodle guide Calculator Guidelines for a list of appropriate calculators.</p>
<h4 id="test-format">Test Format</h4>
<p>Each exam will be taken as a Moodle quiz. If you select a remote proctor, your proctor must be able to administer this type of exam. You may not bring your own laptop to the testing center to take the exam.</p>

<h4 id="requirements-for-credit-only-su-grading">Requirements for Credit-Only (S/U) Grading</h4>
<p>In order to receive a grade of S, students are required to take all exams, complete all assignments, and earn a grade of C- or better. Conversion from letter grading to credit only (S/U) grading is subject to university deadlines. Refer to the Registration and Records calendar for deadlines related to grading. For more details refer to <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-15">REG 02.20.15 - Credit-Only Courses.</a></p>
<p>It is the student's responsibility to check if an S grade gives progress towards their degree(s).</p>
<h4 id="requirements-for-auditors-au">Requirements for Auditors (AU)</h4>
<p>Information about and requirements for auditing a course can be found at <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-04">REG 02.20.04 - Audits.</a></p>
<h4 id="policies-on-incomplete-grades">Policies on Incomplete Grades</h4>
<h5 id="nc-state-policy">NC State Policy</h5>
<p>At the discretion of the instructor, students may be given an IN grade for work not completed because of a serious interruption in their work not caused by their own negligence. An IN must not be used, however, as a substitute for an F when the student's performance in the course is deserving of failing. An IN is only appropriate when the student's record in the course is such that the successful completion of particular assignments, projects, or tests missed as a result of a documented serious event would enable that student to pass the course.</p>
<p>If an extended deadline is not authorized by the instructor or department, an unfinished incomplete grade will automatically change to an F after either (a) the end of the next regular semester in which the student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) the end of 12 months if the student is not enrolled, whichever is shorter. Incompletes that change to F will count as an attempted course on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade is the responsibility of the student. See the university policy on incomplete grades: <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03">REG 02.50.03 - Grades and Grade Point Average.</a></p>

<h3 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h3>
<h4 id="student-expenses">Student Expenses</h4>
<p>If you participate in the Course Ready program, then this covers the cost of WebAssign for you. Otherwise, the cost of WebAssign is approximately $87.95 for this class. To access WebAssign for the first time, please click on the first link in the WebAssign Homework Section. You will need to log into your Cengage account (or create an account). Do not create a new account if you already have a Cengage account.</p>
<h4 id="late-assignments">Late Assignments</h4>
<p>For WebAssign homework, you may take extensions on an assignment up to exactly 7 days after the assignment's original due date/time. You may take as many extensions as you wish during this 7 day extension period window.</p>
<p>Each extension lasts for 24 hours OR until the assignment is exactly 7 days past due, whichever comes first. To extend beyond 24 hours, you must wait for the original 24 hours to expire.</p>
<p>You will receive full credit for any answers you get correct before the original due date. Any work completed during the extension period will incur a penalty of -20%.</p>
<p>Note that these 7 days may include weekends, holidays, etc. The extension period is always for exactly one calendar week.</p>
<p>It may be possible in Cengage to extend due dates for the last few assignments beyond the time when I submit grades to MyPack. However, work completed after grades are submitted will not contribute to your semester grade. Please ensure that you have made up any extended work by your final exam.</p>
<h4 id="late-examinations">Late Examinations</h4>
<p>If an exam is missed with an excused absence (i.e., for a university-approved reason, with supporting documentation), then a make-up test will be scheduled individually. If an exam is missed for an unexcused absence, that exam will be given a score of 0. No make-ups will be allowed. Documentation for an excused absence must be provided within 1 week of the missed class. All absences that require a make-up exam or other special accommodations must go through the NCSU absence verification process; here is the link to that office: <a href="https://dasa.ncsu.edu/students/absence-verification-process/">NC State Absence Verification.</a></p>
<p>You must schedule exams in a timely fashion to guarantee that you will be able to take them. It is the instructor's discretion if a makeup exam will be allowed if you are not able to schedule an exam appointment within the selected time frame. If the instructor approves a make-up exam, there will be a penalty of 10% on that exam.</p>
<h4 id="attendance">Attendance</h4>
<p>Since this course is an asynchronous online course, there is no daily attendance. Instead, each student's participation in Moodle is tracked.</p>
<h4 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h4>
<p>Students are required to comply with the university policy on academic integrity found in the Code of Student Conduct (<a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01">NCSU POL11.35.01</a>).</p>
<p>Your submission of any exam indicates "I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this test or assignment." Violations of academic integrity will be handled in accordance with the Student Discipline Procedures (<a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-11-35-02/">NCSU REG 11.35.02</a>).</p>
<p>Below are guidelines specific to this course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tests: Proctored tests are closed book assessments. You may not consult any internet resources or receive help from anyone else. You may use a basic calculator on your tests.</li>
<li>Homework: You may consult your notes, the textbook, each other, or online resources. You may not post the problem on any website (ex. Chegg) but you may post questions to our Yellowdig forum.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="disability-resources">Disability Resources</h4>
<p>Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations, students must register with the Disability Resource Office at Holmes Hall, Suite 304, 2751 Cates Avenue, Campus Box 7509, 919-515-7653.

<h4 id="non-discrimination-policy">Non-Discrimination Policy</h4>
<p>NC State University provides equality of opportunity in education and employment for all students and employees. Accordingly, NC State affirms its commitment to maintain a work environment for all employees and an academic environment for all students that is free from all forms of discrimination. Discrimination based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation is a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State University policy and will not be tolerated. Harassment of any person (either in the form of quid pro quo or creation of a hostile environment) based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation also is a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State University policy and will not be tolerated. Retaliation against any person who complains about discrimination is also prohibited. NC State's policies and regulations covering discrimination, harassment, and retaliation may be accessed at</p>

<h4 id="course-evaluations">Course Evaluations</h4>
<p>ClassEval is the end-of-semester survey for students to evaluate instruction of all university classes. The current survey is administered online and includes 12 closed-ended questions and 3 open-ended questions. Deans, department heads, and instructors may add a limited number of their own questions to these 15 common-core questions.</p>
<p>Each semester students' responses are compiled into a ClassEval report for every instructor and class. Instructors use the evaluations to improve instruction and include them in their promotion and tenure dossiers, while department heads use them in annual reviews. The reports are included in instructors' personnel files and are considered confidential.</p>
<p>Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete during the last two weeks of the semester for full semester courses and the last week of shorter sessions. Students will receive an email directing them to a website to complete class evaluations. These become unavailable at 8am on the first day of finals.</p>
