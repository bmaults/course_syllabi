<h3 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>We will continue the study calculus of a single-variable. Two goals in each unit and across the semester are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Improve and refine mathematical problem-solving abilities. Students will apply the course definitions and theory correctly to set up and solve a variety of calculus problems. These problems include applications to physics and engineering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop logical reasoning skills. Students will improve their ability to read and analyze mathematical problems, formulate a solution, and interpret their result.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>More specifically, upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply a variety of integration techniques Students will compute definite and indefinite integrals using substitution, integration by parts, trigonometric identities, partial fractions, and numerical methods such as the Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson’s Rule.</li>
<li>Interpret the meaning of integrals in physical and geometric contexts Students will solve problems involving arc length, surface area, average value, work, fluid force, and center of mass using appropriate integrals.</li>
<li>Analyze sequences and determine convergence Students will use limit laws and formal definitions to identify convergence or divergence of sequences.</li>
<li>Determine convergence of infinite series Students will apply convergence tests, including the geometric series test, comparison tests, ratio test, root test, and alternating series test, to determine whether a given series converges.</li>
<li>Construct and use power series representations of functions Students will find Taylor and Maclaurin series, determine intervals of convergence, and manipulate series through term-by-term differentiation and integration.</li>
<li>Model and solve basic ordinary differential equations Students will solve separable and linear differential equations, interpret slope fields, apply Euler’s method, and solve second-order linear differential equations with constant coefficients using characteristic equations and the method of undetermined coefficients.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h3>
<h4 id="time-commitment">Time Commitment</h4>
<p>MA 241 is a fast-paced course. On-campus sections during a regular semester meet 4-5 days a week for up to 250 minutes total. This asynchronous online section condenses the on-campus version for flexibility, but you should expect a learning experience comparable to the number of minutes of in-class contact.</p>
<p>It is important to understand the time commitment required to succeed. In accordance with academic standards, each college credit hour equates to approximately three hours of work per week over a full semester. This 3:1 ratio is well-established in Higher Education — <a href="https://oucc.dasa.ncsu.edu/courses/contact-credit-hours/">please click here for NC State's summary of this standard</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, for this four-credit hour course, you should expect to devote roughly <strong>12 hours per week</strong> to course-related activities in a regular semester. This includes time spent on lectures, readings, assignments, and study. One possible breakdown (may vary week to week):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lectures and instructional content: Expect to spend around <strong>4 regular semester hours per week</strong> engaging with lectures and other course materials. This includes viewing online lectures and reviewing supplementary materials. This does not include studying or re-watching lectures.</p>
<p>In accordance with accreditation standards, the entire semester of lecture materials should account for about 50 hours:</p>
<p>$$
50 \text{ weeks } \times 4 \, \frac{\text{credit hours}}{\text{week}} \times 50 \, \frac{\text{min}}{\text{credit hour}} = 3000 \text{ total minutes} = 50 \text{ total hours}.
$$</p>
<p>Approximate total video run-time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit 0: 1 hour, 0 minutes, 5 seconds (plus activities during Week 1)  </li>
<li>Unit 1: 4 hours, 44 minutes, 52 seconds  </li>
<li>Unit 2: 3 hours, 49 minutes, 49 seconds  </li>
<li>Unit 3 Pt 1: 5 hours, 59 minutes, 6 seconds  </li>
<li>Unit 3 Pt 2: 4 hours, 29 minutes, 19 seconds  </li>
<li>Unit 4 Pt 1: 4 hours, 37 minutes, 18 seconds  </li>
<li>Unit 4 Pt 2: 3 hours, 23 minutes, 53 seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>The combined total run time for Units 1–4 is <strong>27 hours, 04 minutes, and 17 seconds</strong>. However, as videos move faster than in-class meetings, expect viewing the lecture content to take <strong>1.5–2× the posted time</strong>, depending on the student, for an average of about 47.5 hours. Together with the activities in Unit 0, this figure amounts to 50 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Please reach out any time you are burdened; we can discuss ways to balance your workload.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assignments and assessments: Approximately <strong>4 hours per week</strong> should be allocated to completing homework and preparing for exams. Regular practice is crucial.</p>
</li>
<li>Self-study and review: Dedicate around <strong>4 hours per week</strong> for self-study (reviewing lectures and notes, reading the textbook, solving additional problems).</li>
</ul>
<p>These are estimated times and may vary based on your prior familiarity with calculus. If you find yourself spending significantly more time, please reach out for assistance in <strong>Office Hours</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="lecture-materials">Lecture Materials</h4>
<p>This course uses pre-recorded, interactive lectures created for NC State students and hosted on YouTube for convenient access. Each lecture is an activity that records a score.</p>
<p>At a minimum, every recorded lecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>includes pop-up questions (look for the small open bubbles on the timeline), and</li>
<li>concludes with a two-choice summary where you select the correct statement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your Lecture Activity Score for each unit affects how the test subscores for that unit are curved. See the Test Curving section for details.</p>
<p>After finishing a lecture, go to the <strong>Summary &amp; Submit</strong> page to review your score and submit it to the gradebook.</p>
<h4 id="scoring-mishaps">Scoring mishaps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Partially completed lectures: If you begin a lecture but do not finish it in one sitting, Moodle may record pop-up answers incorrectly (for example, showing 0 points). For best results, start a lecture only when you can complete it without interruptions.</li>
<li>Re-opening after submission: If you reopen a lecture after submitting, the displayed score inside the activity may appear lower. This is a display issue only—do not re-click Submit. Your gradebook stores the correct submitted grade; verify via the gradebook if unsure.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a glitch causes your lecture score to show below 80% after you have completed the overall unit, contact the instructor. The 80–100% buffer exists to accommodate these discrepancies.</p>
<h4 id="watching-on-youtube">Watching on YouTube</h4>
<p>You may view videos directly on YouTube, but to receive full curve credit you must answer the pop-up questions inside Moodle. Do not rely exclusively on YouTube if you want the maximum credit possible to you. In addition, I may consult your Moodle viewer logs to see if you are following the material; watching the videos through Moodle gives a more accurate picture of your study habits.</p>
<p>Videos are hosted on YouTube and may include short ads before or after content. Ads do not reflect the instructor’s or NC State’s views and are not selected by the instructor.</p>
<h4 id="live-sessions">Live sessions</h4>
<p>This course is completely asynchronous, which means that students have no real-time class meeting requirements. Learning materials, activities, assignments, and assessments are delivered through Moodle, a secure and easy-to-use online learning platform. There may be occasional optional Zoom meetings, please find the link to them on the course calendar.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="communication-and-getting-help">Communication and Getting Help</h3>
<h4 id="forum">Forum</h4>
<p>We will use the Yellowdig platform for our course community and discussions. Ideally, math questions should be asked in office hours or on Yellowdig. In general, I will not answer math questions sent by email-if you have a math question you would like to send to me, please post it on Yellowdig. I will monitor and respond to questions on Yellowdig.</p>
<p>As you create posts and make comments, and as other students react to or comment on your posts, you will automatically receive participation points. The points you earn in Yellowdig are passed to the Moodle gradebook for your discussion credit.</p>
<p>To get 100% for your recitation score, you will need to accumulate points each week over the course of the semester. Here is how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are "weekly periods" in the course. The forum will open on the first day of class, which will serve as the first "week". Holiday weeks (Fall Break, Thanksgiving Break) are merged with neighboring weeks, and the week of final exams is merged with the last week of class.</li>
<li>To stay on pace, you should aim to earn 1000 points for each weekly period. However, you can actually earn up to 1350 points per week. Therefore, you can create a buffer in case you fall short in any week.</li>
<li>At 11:59 pm at the end of each weekly period, the weekly points will reset. You will have a new period in which to earn up to 1350/1000. You can keep posting even after you have reached the weekly maximum; you just will stop earning additional credit toward your grade until the next reset.</li>
<li>You may exceed the maximum semester point total in Yellowdig, but the maximum score in Moodle is 100%.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start, please use the "Introductions/Community" Topic and share a bit about who you are and what you are hoping to get out of taking this class. Please feel welcome to share pictures, videos, or interesting links about you and your accomplishments!</p>
<h4 id="email">Email</h4>
<p>Email may be used for confidential and private discussions about grades, scheduling office hours, etc. In general, I may not respond to email outside of business hours (M-F, 9am-5pm). It may take 24-72 hours for me to respond to an email. Please include MA 241 in the subject of the email. Math questions are best asked in office hours or on our on forum, not by email.</p>
<h4 id="tutoring-centers">Tutoring Centers</h4>
<p>During the regular school year, there is free help available on campus for MA 241. See the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu/undergraduate/courses-faq/math-multimedia-center/">Math Tutoring Center (MTC)</a> in SAS 2105. This room has many computers available so that you can work on your assignments. The room is a low-stress environment: you may work quietly in the room without engaging a tutor, or you may ask questions of the graduate tutors when they are available.</li>
<li><a href="https://asc.dasa.ncsu.edu/tutoring-and-mentoring/drop-in-tutoring/">Academic Success Center (ASC)</a> in D.H. Hill Library has a few options:<ul>
<li><a href="https://asc.dasa.ncsu.edu/tutoring-and-mentoring/drop-in-tutoring/">ASC Drop-In Tutoring</a></li>
<li><a href="https://asc.dasa.ncsu.edu/tutoring-and-mentoring/appointment-tutoring/">ASC Appointment Tutoring</a></li>
<li><a href="https://asc.dasa.ncsu.edu/tutoring-and-mentoring/weekly-group-tutoring/">ASC Weekly Group Tutoring</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For Drop-In Tutoring hours, notice the MTC is open during the day, and the ASC is open in the evening.</p>
<p>You should email me for confidential and private discussions about grades, scheduling office hours, etc. Be sure to use the Email Me forum in Moodle rather than sending a message direct to my NC State gmail. This feature in Moodle helps me find and respond to all of my student messages efficiently.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="textbook-and-webassign">Textbook and WebAssign</h3>
<p>Our textbook is Calculus for Engineers and Scientists, Volume I by John Franke, John Griggs, and Larry Norris, from NC State University. The text is in pdf format and is available to students under the Resources tab on WebAssign. </p>
<p>Please see information about purchasing WebAssign under Student Expenses. Do not create a new account if you already have a Cengage account. If you have trouble accessing Cengage, please post on the class forum.</p>
<p>The WebAssign homework assignments are obtained, submitted, and graded online with grades appearing in the course Gradebook. Please find our assignments on Moodle.</p>
<h4 id="recommendations">Recommendations:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Work ahead of schedule. Due dates are chosen to ensure that you have ample time between the videos and the due dates, but you should work on the homework sets as you watch the videos.</li>
<li>Print each assignment and work it with pencil and paper before submitting. I recommend collection your final solutions in a binder, spiral notebook, or similar.</li>
<li>Number each homework set and your work for each problem so that you can study it later. Do not work problems out on unlabeled scratch paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your WebAssign average in the Moodle gradebook will be a weighted arithmetic mean based on each assignment's point total. For example, your score on an assignment worth 50 points counts more than your score on an assignment worth 10 points.</p>
<h4 id="webassign-due-dates">WebAssign Due Dates</h4>
<p>Due dates are listed with each assignment on WebAssign. I encourage you to work on each WebAssign as soon as possible—do not wait until the due date to begin. Please feel free to discuss WebAssign on Yellowdig (the course forum), including the specifics of problems and your attempts at solutions.</p>
<p>When you have finished an assignment, you can click Mark as done in Moodle to indicate for your records that the assignment is completed.</p>
<h4 id="extensions-and-dropped-grades">Extensions and Dropped Grades</h4>
<ul>
<li>Need extra time? WebAssign will also allow you to take a seven-day extension for 80% credit (a 20% penalty). You set this up yourself directly in WebAssign. How this works: if an assignment has 5 questions, each worth 10 points, and you need more time to finish #5, then your grade is a maximum 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 8 = 48. (The 80% does not affect the problems you did on time.)</li>
<li>Your three lowest scores, as determined by Moodle's computational algorithm, are automatically dropped in the Moodle gradebook.</li>
<li>A few sections may be marked as Extra Credit (up to instructor discretion). These are completely optional and the related material is not tested.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of these policies, extensions from the instructor are generally not given. You should try to complete every assignment as soon as you can and as best as you can so that you can self-extend assignments (and/or have them dropped) in case of emergencies. If you have extenuating circumstances that affect more than three assignments, please contact me to discuss your situation, but it needs to be first documented with Absence Verification.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="proctors">Proctors</h4>
<p>All examinations will be proctored through DELTA. You will either take your exam with DELTA, or coordinate remote proctoring with DELTA, according to which situation best describes you:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you live less than 50 miles away from Raleigh, NC, then you will take your tests on our campus through the Distance Education Testing Centers. Students should be mindful of closing hours for both Testing Centers, and give themselves plenty of time to complete their exams. For information, please visit <a href="https://testing-services.delta.ncsu.edu/testing-services-on-campus/">DELTA on-campus testing services.</a></li>
<li>Those students who live more than 50 miles away from Raleigh, NC do not have to take their tests on NCSU campus. They may use a proctor in their town for testing. The proctor must be approved in advance through DELTA (not the instructor). It can take up to 1 week to verify a proctor and set up all needed contact info, so please do this early! Please visit the remote proctor website at <a href="https://testing-services.delta.ncsu.edu/testing-services-remote/">DELTA remote proctoring.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the word <em>remote</em> in this context means that you are using a professional testing site (for example, a testing center, a local library, a college, etc.) other than DELTA. Remote testing does not mean testing at home.</p>
<h4 id="calculators">Calculators</h4>
<p>You may use basic (four-function) calculators on exams. These calculators must have no calculus or graphing capabilities. </p>
<p>If you are on-campus, you may rent a suitable calculator from the NC State Libraries: <a href="https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/devices/calculators">Calculator rentals at NC State Libraries</a>. See the Moodle guide Calculator Guidelines for a list of appropriate calculators.</p>
<h4 id="test-format">Test Format</h4>
<p>Each exam will be taken as a Moodle quiz. If you select a remote proctor, your proctor must be able to administer this type of exam. You may not bring your own laptop to the testing center to take the exam.</p>

<h4 id="requirements-for-credit-only-su-grading">Requirements for Credit-Only (S/U) Grading</h4>
<p>In order to receive a grade of S, students are required to take all exams, complete all assignments, and earn a grade of C- or better. Conversion from letter grading to credit only (S/U) grading is subject to university deadlines. Refer to the Registration and Records calendar for deadlines related to grading. For more details refer to <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-15">REG 02.20.15 - Credit-Only Courses.</a></p>
<p>It is the student's responsibility to check if an S grade gives progress towards their degree(s).</p>

<p>Information about and requirements for auditing a course can be found at <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-04">REG 02.20.04 - Audits.</a></p>
<h4 id="policies-on-incomplete-grades">Policies on Incomplete Grades</h4>
<h5 id="nc-state-policy">NC State Policy</h5>
<p>At the discretion of the instructor, students may be given an IN grade for work not completed because of a serious interruption in their work not caused by their own negligence. An IN must not be used, however, as a substitute for an F when the student's performance in the course is deserving of failing. An IN is only appropriate when the student's record in the course is such that the successful completion of particular assignments, projects, or tests missed as a result of a documented serious event would enable that student to pass the course.</p>
<p>If an extended deadline is not authorized by the instructor or department, an unfinished incomplete grade will automatically change to an F after either (a) the end of the next regular semester in which the student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) the end of 12 months if the student is not enrolled, whichever is shorter. Incompletes that change to F will count as an attempted course on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade is the responsibility of the student. See the university policy on incomplete grades: <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03">REG 02.50.03 - Grades and Grade Point Average.</a></p>
<h5 id="my-individual-policy-on-incomplete-grades">My individual policy on incomplete grades</h5>
<p>For reference, here is a common statement at other institutions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The grade of IN denotes an incomplete grade for the course, and will be awarded only when the student has done satisfactory work up to the last two weeks of the semester, but for nonacademic reasons beyond their control is unable to meet the full requirements of the course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an incomplete grade is solely at my discretion, here is the criteria I used when assessing a request for an incomplete grade:</p>
<ul>
<li>A grade of IN is given only because of documented serious interruption. It is not given because of general difficulties completing the semester due to a heavy workload. I may ask to speak with your advisor about the IN request.</li>
<li>The events affecting the student's ability to complete assignments must be fully documented (e.g. doctor's note with contact information, obituary). You should provide this documentation by the day following the last day of the Final Exam.</li>
<li>The interruption should not occur before the drop/revision date of the semester. This semester, that date is 10/23.</li>
<li>The student's Moodle activity log should show regular course participation up to the documented event. The course log should not show multiple lapses in participation (for example, more than two regular semester weeks with no meaningful activity).</li>
<li>The student's cumulative grade in the gradebook should be at least 50 by the last day of class.</li>
<li>As the intention of an IN grade is to enable a student to pass the course, IN grades are rarely appropriate if the student's end-of-semester grade is at least a C.</li>
<li>An IN grade is a serious situation so that the student may pass the class. Homework and class participation grades (e.g. Yellowdig) are not extended, only test grades may be made up. Given the way examinations in this course is structured, the student should be able to pass this course by making up (at a maximum) one test and the final exam.</li>
<li>Failure to schedule the Final Exam at an appropriate time is not a "documented serious event." This act results in a 0 on Final Exam subscores. Due to how test scores are computed in this class, the sole act of missing the Final Exam is not a reason that a student does not pass this course. An IN is therefore never appropriate due to a scheduling mistake.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="how-to-proceed-with-an-incomplete-grade">How to Proceed with an Incomplete Grade</h5>
<p>If all of the above requirements are met and an incomplete grade is deemed appropriate, here is the expected course of action:</p>
<ol>
<li>To initiate a conversation about the IN grade, use the Email Me forum.</li>
<li>Exams must be able to be made up with an approved proctor or at DELTA before the end of the next semester. Examity is not an option.</li>
<li>If an IN grade is administered, it is the student's responsibility to schedule and make-up their work. The instructor will not initiate anything without contact from the student.<ul>
<li>All exam appointments must be scheduled by the Drop/Revision day of the following regular-year semester (following the original semester). Waiting too long to schedule makeups exams may mean that no testing appointments are available. This situation will cause the IN grade to become an F.</li>
<li>To allow me time to assess and submit your grade change to MyPack, the student must make up missing exams by the (first) Reading Day of the following semester.</li>
<li>After completing the missing one or two exams, the student must alert me directly by regular email that graded assignments are ready. The student should include a direct link (URL) to the Moodle site where the exam(s) is/are located.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Moodle site may become unavailable except for the tests needed. Preparation materials, lessons, etc. may no longer be available. I will not meet to teach or review any concepts. (My course videos remain available to all on YouTube.)</li>
<li>The student will not receive any exam feedback.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h3>
<h4 id="student-expenses">Student Expenses</h4>
<p>If you participate in the Course Ready program, then this covers the cost of WebAssign for you. Otherwise, the cost of WebAssign is approximately $87.95 for this class. To access WebAssign for the first time, please click on the first link in the WebAssign Homework Section. You will need to log into your Cengage account (or create an account). Do not create a new account if you already have a Cengage account.</p>
<h4 id="late-assignments">Late Assignments</h4>
<p>For WebAssign homework, you may take extensions on an assignment up to exactly 7 days after the assignment's original due date/time. You may take as many extensions as you wish during this 7 day extension period window.</p>
<p>Each extension lasts for 24 hours OR until the assignment is exactly 7 days past due, whichever comes first. To extend beyond 24 hours, you must wait for the original 24 hours to expire.</p>
<p>You will receive full credit for any answers you get correct before the original due date. Any work completed during the extension period will incur a penalty of -20%.</p>
<p>Note that these 7 days may include weekends, holidays, etc. The extension period is always for exactly one calendar week.</p>
<p>It may be possible in Cengage to extend due dates for the last few assignments beyond the time when I submit grades to MyPack. However, work completed after grades are submitted will not contribute to your semester grade. Please ensure that you have made up any extended work by your final exam.</p>
<h4 id="late-examinations">Late Examinations</h4>
<p>If an exam is missed with an excused absence (i.e., for a university-approved reason, with supporting documentation), then a make-up test will be scheduled individually. If an exam is missed for an unexcused absence, that exam will be given a score of 0. No make-ups will be allowed. Documentation for an excused absence must be provided within 1 week of the missed class. All absences that require a make-up exam or other special accommodations must go through the NCSU absence verification process; here is the link to that office: <a href="https://dasa.ncsu.edu/students/absence-verification-process/">NC State Absence Verification.</a></p>
<p>You must schedule exams in a timely fashion to guarantee that you will be able to take them. It is the instructor's discretion if a makeup exam will be allowed if you are not able to schedule an exam appointment within the selected time frame. If the instructor approves a make-up exam, there will be a penalty of 10% on that exam.</p>
<h4 id="attendance">Attendance</h4>
<p>Since this course is an asynchronous online course, there is no daily attendance. Instead, each student's participation in Moodle is tracked.</p>

<h4 id="course-evaluations">Course Evaluations</h4>
<p>ClassEval is the end-of-semester survey for students to evaluate instruction of all university classes. The current survey is administered online and includes 12 closed-ended questions and 3 open-ended questions. Deans, department heads, and instructors may add a limited number of their own questions to these 15 common-core questions.</p>
<p>Each semester students' responses are compiled into a ClassEval report for every instructor and class. Instructors use the evaluations to improve instruction and include them in their promotion and tenure dossiers, while department heads use them in annual reviews. The reports are included in instructors' personnel files and are considered confidential.</p>
<p>Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete during the last two weeks of the semester for full semester courses and the last week of shorter sessions. Students will receive an email directing them to a website to complete class evaluations. These become unavailable at 8am on the first day of finals.</p>
